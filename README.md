# Cybersecurity-Blue-Team-Skills-Documentation

A hands-on cybersecurity portfolio documenting practical training and investigations across **SOC operations, Blue Team security, Network Traffic Analysis, Malware Analysis, IDS/IPS, Phishing Analysis, Digital Forensics, DFIR, and Threat Intelligence**.

This repository focuses on **practical skill development and methodology documentation** through security investigation labs and simulated incident scenarios.

The goal is to demonstrate the ability to investigate security events, analyze evidence, correlate indicators across different data sources, and document findings using tools and techniques commonly used by SOC and Blue Team teams.

---

## Portfolio Objective

This repository was built as a practical training record to develop and document core **Blue Team and SOC Analyst skills**.

The investigations cover different stages of the defensive security workflow, including:

- Security alert triage
- Network traffic analysis
- IDS/IPS investigation
- SIEM investigation
- Malware analysis
- Phishing analysis
- Windows endpoint investigation
- Digital forensics and DFIR
- Threat intelligence enrichment
- IOC identification and correlation
- Command-and-Control (C2) investigation
- Detection engineering
- Incident reconstruction

Rather than documenting only the final results of each challenge, the individual reports focus on **how the investigation was performed**, including the analysis methodology, queries, filters, forensic artifacts, and investigative pivots used to reach the findings.

## Investigation Methodology

Across the portfolio, investigations generally follow a structured defensive workflow:

```
Alert / Suspicious Activity
            ↓
       Initial Triage
            ↓
    Identify Key Artifacts
            ↓
     Filter Relevant Data
            ↓
   Correlate Related Events
            ↓
Threat Intelligence Enrichment
            ↓
       Scope Expansion
            ↓
Reconstruct Attack Activity
            ↓
    Identify IOCs / TTPs
            ↓

## Training Context

The investigations documented in this repository were completed as part of hands-on cybersecurity training and simulated security scenarios.

The purpose of the repository is **skill development, practical repetition, and technical documentation**.

The individual reports intentionally focus on the investigation process rather than publishing challenge answers. Sensitive challenge-specific indicators, flags, credentials, and direct answers are omitted where appropriate.

---

## Disclaimer

All investigations documented here were performed in controlled training environments for educational and defensive security purposes.

The repository does not contain real-world victim data, credentials, or unauthorized access information.

The techniques documented are presented for **defensive security analysis, detection engineering, incident response, and cybersecurity education**.
